In a forgotten corner of the universe, time rippled like water, reflecting the echoes of souls long gone. With each step, memories whispered, ancient and profound. Their journey intertwined with the fabric of existence, stitching together the fragments of forgotten lore. Worlds rose and fell, stars flickered and died, yet their quest endured, a beacon in the endless expanse. For in the tapestry of time, they sought not just answers, but the essence of eternity itself, where past, present, and future converged in silent harmony.
